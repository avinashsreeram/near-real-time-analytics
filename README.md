# Real-Time Credit Card Transaction Visualization

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time visualization system for credit card transactions using AWS services. It focuses on identifying transaction patterns, detecting potential fraudulent activities, and analyzing spending behavior in near real-time.

## Introduction
The rapid evolution of digital finance has significantly increased the volume and complexity of credit card transactions. Traditional data processing methods often fail to provide timely insights and may miss fraudulent activities. This project addresses these challenges by creating a robust visualization system that leverages AWS tools to enable real-time analytics and enhanced decision-making capabilities for financial institutions.

## System Architecture
The system integrates multiple AWS services to facilitate real-time data streaming and visualization:
- **AWS Kinesis Firehose**: Manages the ingestion of streaming data.
- **AWS S3**: Acts as the storage layer for processed data.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes and transforms streaming data.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Used for creating dynamic visualizations and dashboards to represent transactional data.

## System Latency
The end-to-end latency from data generation to visualization in Amazon QuickSight is approximately 15 minutes, primarily due to the data processing pipeline and refresh rates in QuickSight. This setup is optimal for near real-time analytics on high-velocity data streams in financial transaction scenarios.

## Architecture Diagram
Below is the system architecture diagram that illustrates the data flow and integration of AWS services:

## Data Flow
1. **Data Source**: Transactional data is simulated from a static CSV file, representing real-world financial transactions.
2. **Transformation**: Data is converted into JSON format suitable for streaming.
3. **Streaming**: Utilizes Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing capabilities to emulate real-time data flow, pushing data to AWS Kinesis Firehose.
4. **Visualization**: Data is visualized in Amazon QuickSight, providing insights into patterns and anomalies.

## Visualizations and Dashboards
Here are some screenshots from the Amazon QuickSight dashboards created as part of this project:

## Goals and Objectives
- **Real-time Analytics**: Provide financial institutions with the ability to perform real-time analytics on credit card transactions.
- **Fraud Detection**: Enhance the detection of fraudulent activities by analyzing spending patterns and anomalies as they occur.
- **Actionable Insights**: Generate actionable insights that can be used to inform decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Kinesis Firehose, S3, Lambda, QuickSight**: For handling data streaming, storage, processing, and visualization.
- **Python**: For data processing and integration with AWS services.

## Setup and Installation
1. **AWS Configuration**: Set up AWS services mentioned in the system architecture.
2. **Data Simulation**: Run the Python script to simulate data streaming.
3. **QuickSight Setup**: Configure Amazon QuickSight for data visualization.

## Future Work
- Expand the real-time data processing capabilities using Apache Kafka and Kibana.
- Implement visual alerts to highlight fraudulent transactions more effectively.

## Conclusion
This project represents a significant step forward in the use of modern cloud technologies to enhance the visualization and analysis of financial data in real time. It promises to deliver critical insights that can help safeguard and optimize financial operations.
